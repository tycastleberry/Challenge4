## Analysis for Potential Investment Options

The purpose of this project is to perform a quantitative analysis for (4) funds and the S&P 500. Performance, volatility, risk, risk-return profile, and portfolio diversification
will all be considered during the analysis. Upon completion of the analysis, I'll make a decision about which fund to recommend for inclusion in our firm's portfolio. 

## Technologies

This project with be built in a Jupyter notebook. I'll use the Path module from the pathlib library, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy to complete the analysis.

## Installation Guide

The risk_return_analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains data from (1) CSV file: whale_navs.csv. The file contains data about portfolios with net asset value (NAV) pricing from
four whale investors. It also contains data about the S&P 500 index, which will serve as the benchmark of the analysis.

## Usage

The cells in the notebook have been fully executed. All of the analysis with supporting statistics and plots are ready for review.
